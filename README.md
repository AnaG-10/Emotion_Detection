Emotion Detection — Fuzzy vs Neural Network Models

This research project compares emotion-recognition performance between fuzzy logic-based models and deep learning CNN models. We evaluate EfficientNet, ResNet, and a Fuzzy Emotion Classifier, trained on two different datasets, giving a total of six trained models.

The goal is to analyze:

- Performance difference between Fuzzy and Neural Network approaches

- Comparison between EfficientNet vs ResNet vs Fuzzy

- How dataset quality affects accuracy

- Which model generalizes best during inference

🎯 Goals

1) Train three models (EfficientNet, ResNet, Fuzzy)

2) Train on two datasets, producing six models

3) Generate:

- Confusion Matrix

- Accuracy Graph

- Loss Graph

- 3×2 Comparison Matrix

- Perform inference through image upload in inf.py

📊 Performance Metrics

We measure:

- Accuracy

- Validation loss

- Confusion matrix

- F1-score

- Precision & Recall

- Model comparison across datasets

A final 3 × 2 matrix summarizes:

- EfficientNet

- ResNet
